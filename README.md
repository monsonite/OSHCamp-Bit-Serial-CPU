# OSHCamp-Bit-Serial-CPU

Here I describe a proposed bit serial CPU intended for a presentation and workshop session at OSHCamp 2024 on 24th and 25th August.

Each year, open source hardware enthusiasts gather in the picturesque town of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire for a long weekend of talks, discussions and practical hardware workshops.

I am proposing a bit-serial CPU kit, and a general presentation of bit serial computing.
